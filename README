This repo contains personal notes and Python code that follows Mike Cohen's book Analysing Neural Time Data [1]. People that may be interested in this content include those that, like me, adventured in following the book using a free alternative to the Matlab environment.

The file sampleEEGdata.mat contains EEG data made avaliable the author freely at http://www.mikexcohen.com/. The Matlab code in which the implementations here are based can also be obtained at this adress.
